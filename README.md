## 🍽 Restaurant Ratings Analysis Project

## 🧠 Overview
This is a self-driven Data Science internship project completed at **Cognifyz Technologies**.  
The project focuses on analyzing a restaurant dataset to uncover trends, generate insights, and build predictive models to forecast restaurant ratings.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  


## 🎯 Project Highlights
- Explored and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and class imbalances.
- Performed descriptive and geospatial analysis across cities, countries, and cuisines.
- Analyzed features like table booking, online delivery, and price range for their impact on ratings.
- Built predictive models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to forecast restaurant ratings. Random Forest performed best (R² = 0.94).
- Generated actionable business insights for restaurants on optimal cuisines, service features, and pricing strategies.


## 💻 Skills Demonstrated
- Python Programming  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization  
- Feature Engineering  
- Regression & Machine Learning Modeling  
- Business Decision Support  


## 🛠 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and class imbalances.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed trends in ratings by city, country, and cuisine type.
3. **Feature Analysis**  
   - Examined how restaurant features affect ratings.
4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Built Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
   - Random Forest achieved highest accuracy.
5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Derived actionable strategies for restaurants to improve ratings and customer satisfaction.
